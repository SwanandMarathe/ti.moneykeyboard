### Usage

Create the widget in XML
```xml
<Alloy>
	<Window class="container">
		<Widget src="ti.moneykeyboard" name="widget" id="tiMoneyKeyboard" />
        	<Label text="0.00" id="moneyValueLbl" />
	</Window>
</Alloy>
```

Set the widget up inside of your controller.
```javascript

$.tiMoneyKeyboard.setErrorShakeView($.moneyValueLbl); // Set what we should shake when an error happens.
$.tiMoneyKeyboard.setActiveLabel($.moneyValueLbl); // Set what label we should bind the keyboard to. Must bind before opening/closing the keyboard!

```

## API

### Methods
* `open()` - opens the money keyboard.
* `close()` - closes the money keyboard.
* `setActiveLabel()` - used to bind the keyboard to a label that should update when the user enters a money value.
* `setErrorShakeView()` - used to bind the keyboard to a view it should shake when the user trys to enter a value that's too long.
